/*
 By documentation : https://currencylayer.com/documentation
 Free plan can only use the following 4 API:
 # Supported Currencies:
 # Real-time Rates:
 # Historical Rates
 # Specify Output Currencies
 
 Bacause of following 3 reason, I only get all [Real-time Rates] base on USD
 1. In the free plan, getting too much data at the same time will cause the API to fail.
 2. [Real-time Rates] also can get a list of all currencies by calculations.
 3. Functional Requirements require apps not to use API too frequently, so [Specify Output Currencies] cannot be used
